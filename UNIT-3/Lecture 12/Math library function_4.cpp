/*
 Problem Statement
    Benjamin is studying polar coordinates and wants to convert them to Cartesian coordinates.
    Develop a program that takes the radius (r) and angle (Î¸) in degrees as input,
    converts the angle to radians using inbuilt mathematical functions, and outputs the Cartesian coordinates (x, y).

 Formula
    radian = angle * pi / 180.0
    x = radius * cos(radian)
    y = radius * sin(radian)
    The pi value is calculated using M_PI constant from the math library.

 Note: This question helps in clearing AMCAT exam.

 Input format :
    The first line consists of a double-value r, representing the radius.
    The second line consists of a double-value a, representing the angle in degrees.

 Output format :
    The output prints two space-separated double values representing the Cartesian coordinates(x, y), both rounded to one decimal place.
